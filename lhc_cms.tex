\chapter[The CMS experiment at the LHC]{The Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron
Collider \label{chap:LHC_CMS}}

The analysis presented in this thesis uses $\Pp\Pp$ collision data delivered by the Large Hadron
Collider and recorded by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment. An overview of the collider is
given in Section~\ref{chap:LHC}, while the detector setup is discussed in Section~\ref{chap:CMS}.
