The analysis presented in this thesis uses $\Pp\Pp$ collision data delivered by the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) and recorded by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. An overview of the
collider is given in Section~\ref{chap:LHC}, while the detector setup is discussed in
Section~\ref{chap:CMS}.
