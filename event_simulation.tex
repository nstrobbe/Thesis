\subsection{CMS Full Simulation using Geant4 \label{subsec:fullsim}}

% add some info on how this is done, particle interaction with matter, ionization, 
% how it deals with long lived particles?

\subsection{CMS Fast Simulation \label{subsec:fastsim}}

% explain what approximations are made, why it is necessary, especially in SUSY searches
