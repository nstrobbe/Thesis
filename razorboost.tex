\chapter{The razor boost analysis \label{chap:razorboost}}

In this chapter the razor boost analysis will be discussed. 
I will first cover the motivation and general strategy of the analysis in 
sections~\ref{sec:boost_motivation} and \ref{sec:boost_strategy}. Then the \textit{razor variables},
which are our most important discriminating variables, will be derived in 
section~\ref{sec:boost_razor}. Section~\ref{sec:boost_wtag} details the technique used to tag highly
boosted $\W$ bosons. 
The datasets and triggers are listed in Section~\ref{sec:trigger_datasets}, followed by the event
selection in Section~\ref{sec:boost_event_selection}. 
The full statistical treatment, with its likelihood based approach, is explained in 
section~\ref{sec:boost_likelihood}. In section~\ref{sec:boost_systematics} the different sources of
systematic uncertainties are discussed, followed by the results of the full background estimation in
section~\ref{sec:boost_results}. This chapter concludes, in section~\ref{sec:boost_interpretation},
with the interpretation of the results in terms of several simplified model spectra.

\section{Event selection \label{sec:boost_event_selection}}

In this section I will discuss the event selection. I will start by detailing the baseline
selection that is applied, and then move on to the signal region selection and the definition of the
different control regions. 
An overview of those different regions, how they are related and how they are used in the
background estimation was already shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:boost_flowchart}. 

Let us remind ourselves of the goal of the analysis and the basics of the background estimation
method. 
The aim of the analysis is to conduct a search for deviations from the SM in the high $\mr$-high
$\rsq$ region using hadronic events with at least one boosted $\W$ boson and one $b$ jet.
Standard model backgrounds in the signal region are estimated via a likelihood method, using
observations in three control regions in data, labelled $Q$, $T$ and $W$, and transfer factors
$\kappa$, calculated from simulated data, between these control regions and the signal region,
$S$. 
The viability of the defined control regions to model the data in our signal region is tested by
two closure tests, which are presented at the end of this section.
For all details on the full background estimation itself, I refer to
section~\ref{sec:boost_likelihood}.

\section{Results \label{sec:boost_results}}

We present the results of the background prediction for each of the 25 considered search bins in the
$(\mr,\rsq)$ plane in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_prediction} and Table~\ref{tab:results_prediction}. The
results are presented as the mean and standard deviation as determined from the sampled prior
$\pi(\theta)$ described in Section~\ref{sec:boost_systematics}.  
The observations are found to be in good agreement with the standard model prediction. 
No evidence of a signal is found.
We do note that for small counts the mean gives a substantially larger value for the background
prediction than the mode. This is further illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:boost_results_mean_mode} for
two of the predicted background counts. 
The many bins in the high $\mr$, high $\rsq$ region for which the prediction is around one event,
without any observed data are thus no cause for concern.
The full distribution of the counts will be used for the interpretation of the results which
ensures the proper treatment of the non-Gaussian shape.

\section{Interpretation in terms of simplified model spectra \label{sec:boost_interpretation}}

We interpret our results in terms of the simplified models T1ttcc and T1t1t, whose
diagrams were shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:T1ttcc_T1t1t_diagrams}. The general characteristics of
simplified models were discussed in Section~\ref{sec:susy_sms}. These particular models have three
free mass parameters: the mass of the gluino, top squark and LSP. The gluino mass is varied between
600 and 1300\GeV, and the LSP mass between 1 and 700\GeV. The mass difference between top squark and
LSP, $\Delta m$, is kept fixed at 10, 25 or 80\GeV for the T1ttcc model, and at 175\GeV for the
T1t1t model. 

To get a sense of the expected signal sensitivity, we show the signal efficiencies for the T1ttcc
and T1t1t simplified models in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_T1ttcc_T1t1t}, and the expected signal counts in
Fig.~\ref{fig:events_T1ttcc_T1t1t}. 
Efficiencies of up to 6\% in the most highly boosted regimes are reached. 

For the T1ttcc model a sharp drop in efficiency is observed for the strip with the lowest considered
neutralino mass, $m_{\lsp} = 1\GeV$, compared to neighbouring mass points with $m_{\lsp} = 50\GeV$.
This can be explained by Lorentz boosts. The top squark decays into a charm quark and the LSP. The
momentum of the decay products in the lab frame, $p$, is related to the momentum and energy in the
top squark rest frame, $p'$ and $E'$, by $p = \gamma (p' + \beta E')$. Both decay products have the
same momentum in the top squark rest frame, but their energies will depend on their masses. 
For LSP masses higher than the mass of the charm quark, the LSP will have a higher energy
in the top squark rest frame, and consequently will assume most of the momentum in the lab frame.
For the strip with the lowest LSP mass on the other hand, the LSP and the charm quark have
about equal mass. After boosting to the lab frame, they will thus share the momentum about equally.
As the LSP has a lower momentum in this case, this results in a softer \ETm spectrum and therefore a
lower $\rsq$ value, the final result being a substantially reduced efficiency. To illustrate
this, we show the \ETm and \rsq distributions for two example signal points in
Fig.~\ref{fig:boost_eff_drop_met_rsq}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

50\GeV$. [left] Distribution of \ETm with no selection applied.
[right] Distribution of \rsq. The presence of at least two jets was required in order to calculate
the \rsq variable. The arrow indicates the baseline selection requirement of $\rsq > 0.08$.
 \label{fig:boost_eff_drop_met_rsq}}
\end{figure}

The efficiencies for mass points of the T1t1t model are lower than for the equivalent points of the
T1ttcc models. There are two main reasons for this.
Firstly, the top quark is heavier than the charm quark. The afore-mentioned effect will thus occur
not only for the lowest LSP mass, but for all masses smaller than the top quark mass. 
In addition, the combination of the large top quark mass and the considered $\Delta m = 175\GeV$
results in a much smaller mass gap between gluino and top squark compared to the T1ttcc models.
This in turn results in less boosted top quarks, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:boost_gen_toppt},
and thus fewer events passing the boosted $\W$ boson tagger.

As no discrepancy from the SM prediction was observed, we compute upper limits on the allowed
cross section across the parameter space of the T1ttcc and T1t1t models, using the CLs method which
is explained in more detail in Appendix~\ref{app:CLs}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:boost_limits} shows the observed and expected limit for the T1ttcc model with
$\Delta m=10,25,80$\GeV and for the T1t1t model. 
The uncertainty band for the observed limit is computed by varying the signal cross section within
the theoretical uncertainties, of which the PDFs are the main component. The uncertainty on the
expected limit incorporates all experimental uncertainties. 
From these figures we observe that this analysis has made significant inroads into the parameter
space of the T1ttcc model. 
Gluinos with mass up to about 1\TeV have been excluded for neutralinos with mass less than about
500\GeV, when the top squark decays to a charm and a neutralino and $\Delta m < 80\GeV$. This also
means that top squarks with masses up to about 500\GeV have been excluded for small mass
differences with the LSP, given the existence of a gluino with mass less than about 1\TeV. 
Similarly, for the T1t1t model, top squarks with a mass up to about 450\GeV have been excluded
for the scenarios with $\Delta m = 175\GeV$ and gluino mass less than 850\GeV.
Considering again our cartoon from the introduction in Section~\ref{sec:boost_motivation}, we have
now filled in several of the gaps, as we had set out to do. This is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:boost_story_final}.
