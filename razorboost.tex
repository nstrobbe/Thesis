\chapter{The razor boost analysis \label{chap:razorboost}}

In this chapter the razor boost analysis will be discussed. 
I will first cover the motivation and general strategy of the analysis in 
sections~\ref{sec:boost_motivation} and \ref{sec:boost_strategy}. Then the \textit{razor variables},
which are our most important discriminating variables, will be derived in 
section~\ref{sec:boost_razor}. Section~\ref{sec:boost_wtag} details the technique used to tag highly
boosted $\W$ bosons. 
The datasets and triggers are listed in Section~\ref{sec:trigger_datasets}, followed by the event
selection in Section~\ref{sec:boost_event_selection}. 
The full statistical treatment, with its likelihood based approach, is explained in 
section~\ref{sec:boost_likelihood}. In section~\ref{sec:boost_systematics} the different sources of
systematic uncertainties are discussed, followed by the results of the full background estimation in
section~\ref{sec:boost_results}. This chapter concludes, in section~\ref{sec:boost_interpretation},
with the interpretation of the results in terms of several simplified model spectra.

\section{Event selection \label{sec:boost_event_selection}}

In this section I will discuss the event selection. I will start by detailing the baseline
selection that is applied, and then move on to the signal region selection and the definition of the
different control regions. 
An overview of those different regions, how they are related and how they are used in the
background estimation was already shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:boost_flowchart}. 

Let us remind ourselves of the goal of the analysis and the basics of the background estimation
method. 
The aim of the analysis is to conduct a search for deviations from the SM in the high $\mr$-high
$\rsq$ region using hadronic events with at least one boosted $\W$ boson and one $b$ jet.
Standard model backgrounds in the signal region are estimated via a likelihood method, using
observations in three control regions in data, labelled $Q$, $T$ and $W$, and transfer factors
$\kappa$, calculated from simulated data, between these control regions and the signal region,
$S$. 
The viability of the defined control regions to model the data in our signal region is tested by
two closure tests, which are presented at the end of this section.
For all details on the full background estimation itself, I refer to
section~\ref{sec:boost_likelihood}.

\section{Results \label{sec:boost_results}}

We present the results of the background prediction for each bin in the $(\mr,\rsq)$ plane in
Fig.~\ref{fig:results_prediction} and Table~\ref{tab:results_prediction}. The results are presented
as the mean and standard deviation as determined from the sampled prior $\pi(\theta)$
described in Section~\ref{sec:boost_systematics}.  
The observations are found to be in good agreement with the standard model prediction. Consequently,
no evidence of a signal is observed. 
% TODO
% For small counts the mean gives a substantially larger value than the mode, which is why there are
% many bins in the high $M_R$, high $R^2$ region for which the prediction is around 1, and there is no
% data observed.

\section{Interpretation in terms of simplified model spectra \label{sec:boost_interpretation}}

% TODO ref{sec:sms}


We interpret our results in terms of the SMS processes {\it T1ttcc} and {\it T1t1t} shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:T1ttcc_T1t1t_diagrams}. These models have three free mass parameters: the gluino, 
top squark and LSP mass. We will vary the gluino mass between 600 and 1300\GeV, and the LSP 
mass between 1 and 700\GeV. The mass difference between top squark and LSP, $\Delta m$, is kept
fixed at 10, 25 or 80\GeV for the T1ttcc model, and at 175\GeV for the T1t1t model. 

To get a sense of the expected signal sensitivity, we show the signal efficiencies for the T1ttcc
and T1t1t simplified models in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_T1ttcc_T1t1t}. 
Efficiencies of up to 6\% in the most highly boosted regimes  are reached. 
For the T1ttcc model a drop in efficiency is observed for the strip with lowest neutralino
mass ($m_{\chi_1^0} = 1\GeV$), which can be explained by Lorentz boosts. For LSP masses higher than
the mass of the charm quark, the LSP will assume most of the momentum.  For the strip with the
lowest LSP mass, however, the LSP and the charm quark have about equal mass, so that after the boost
they will share the momentum about equally.  This results in a softer \ETm spectrum and therefore a
lower $\rsq$ value, which reduces the efficiency substantially.


% To get a sense of the signal sensitivity we can expect, we show the signal efficiencies, expected
% number of events and significances $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}$ for the T1ttcc simplified model in
% figure~\ref{fig:eff_T1ttcc}, for the T1t1t model in figure~\ref{fig:eff_T1t1t} and for the T2tt
% model in figure~\ref{fig:eff_T2tt}. 
% Efficiencies of up to 7\% in the most boosted regimes of these scans are reached. 
% For the T1ttcc model a drop in efficiency is observed for the strip with lowest neutralino mass
% ($m_{\chi_1^0} = 1\GeV$). 
% For strips with higher LSP masses, the LSP will end up with higher momentum than the charm. For
% the
% lowest LSP mass however, the LSP and the charm have about equal mass, so after the boost they will
% receive about equal amounts of momentum. This results in a lower \ETm spectrum, and in the end a
% lower efficiency. 
% This is explained in more detail in Appendix~\ref{app:eff_drop}.

% TODO Add full explanation from the note on the drop in efficiency 

% \section[Efficiency drop for T1ttcc model points mLSP of 1 GeV]{Efficiency drop for T1ttcc model
% points with $m_{LSP} = 1 \GeV$ \label{app:eff_drop}}
% 
% Looking at the signal efficiencies for the T1ttcc model, we observe that there is a big drop for
% points with $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} = 1\GeV$ compared to the neighbouring points with
% $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} = 50\GeV$. 
% We tracked down at which level of the selection this difference occurs, and found that it happens
% when we apply the $M_R$ and $R^2$ selection. This is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:T1ttcc_eff_SIG}.
% We further found that this is mainly because of the difference in the \ETm distribution, which
% arises because of a difference in the \pt distribution of the LSP, see figure~\ref{fig:MET_LSPpt}.
% It is also interesting to look at the 2D plot of LSP \pt vs charm \pt for two adjacent points. As is
% shown in figure~\ref{fig:LSPpt_vs_charmpt}, both the LSP and the charm can receive any share of the
% momentum in the case where they have about equal mass ($\approx 1\GeV$). In the case where the LSP
% is heavier however, the LSP almost always ends up with more momentum than the charm. 
% We can explain this by performing a simple calculation involving Lorentz boosts.
% 
% The mass points considered here all have a big mass difference between the gluino and the stop. 
% Because of this, the stop is produced with a lot of momentum, \ie it is boosted. 
% Its velocity is given by
%   \begin{equation}
%     \beta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{m_{\tilde{t}_1}^2}{p_{\tilde{t}_1}^2}}}
%   \end{equation}
% with $p_{\tilde{t}_1}$ the magnitude of the stop three-momentum in the lab frame. 
% Using this as boost-factor, we can compute the momentum of the stop decay products in the lab
% frame. 
% In the rest frame of the stop, the LSP and charm have momentum
%   \begin{equation}
%     p' = |\vec{p'}| = \frac{\sqrt{\left(m_{\tilde{t}_1}^2 -
% (m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}+m_c)^2\right)\cdot\left(m_{\tilde{t}_1}^2 -
% (m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}-m_c)^2\right)}}{2m_{\tilde{t}_1}}
%   \end{equation}
% and energy
%   \begin{equation}
%     E'_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} = \frac{m_{\tilde{t}_1}^2 - m_c^2 +
% m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}^2}{2m_{\tilde{t}_1}}
%   \end{equation}
%   \begin{equation}
%     E'_{c} = \frac{m^2 - m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}^2 + m_{c}^2}{2m_{\tilde{t}_1}}
%   \end{equation}
% The formula for a Lorentz boost in one direction (in units $c=1$) is given by 
%   \begin{equation}
%     p = \gamma (p' + vE') = \frac{p' + vE'}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}
%   \end{equation}
% where primed quantities are given in the rest frame of the stop, and unprimed quantities in the lab
% frame. 
% In the labframe, we see the stop rest frame moving with speed $v$.
% 
% Using the formulas listed above, we can compute the energy and momentum of the charm and LSP in the
% rest frame, for a few selected mass points. The results, assuming a stop momentum of $500\GeV$ in
% the lab frame, are given in table~\ref{tab:boost_ex}. For the case where $m_c \approx
% m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}=1\GeV$, the charm and LSP have the same momentum in the lab frame, whereas for
% the case $m_c << m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}$, the LSP has a significantly larger
% momentum compared to the charm. 
% This is consistent with what we observed in the plots earlier.

Figure~\ref{fig:boost_limits} shows the observed and expected limit using the CLs method for the
T1ttcc model with $\Delta m=10,25,80$\GeV and for the T1t1t model. This analysis has
made significant inroads into the parameter space of the T1ttcc model. 
Gluinos with mass up to about 1\TeV have been excluded for neutralinos with mass less than about
500\GeV, when the top squark decays to a charm and a neutralino and $\Delta m < 80\GeV$. This also
means that top squarks with masses up to about 500\GeV have been excluded for small mass
differences with the LSP, given the existence of a gluino with mass less than about 1\TeV. 
Similarly, for the T1t1t model, top squarks with a mass up to about 450\GeV have been excluded
for the scenarios with $\Delta m = 175\GeV$ and gluino mass less than 900\GeV.
Coming back to our cartoon from the introduction in Section~\ref{sec:boost_motivation}, we have now
filled in several of the gaps. This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:boost_story_final}.
