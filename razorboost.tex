\chapter{The razor boost analysis \label{chap:razorboost}}

In this chapter the razor boost analysis will be discussed. 
I will first cover the motivation and general strategy of the analysis in 
sections~\ref{sec:boost_motivation} and \ref{sec:boost_strategy}. Then the \textit{razor variables},
which are our most important discriminating variables, will be derived in 
section~\ref{sec:boost_razor}. Section~\ref{sec:boost_wtag} details the technique used to tag highly
boosted $\W$ bosons. The signal and control region selections are listed in
sections~\ref{sec:boost_signal_selection} and \ref{sec:boost_control_selection}. 
The full statistical treatment, with its likelihood based approach, is explained in 
section~\ref{sec:boost_likelihood}. In section~\ref{sec:boost_systematics} the different sources of
systematic uncertainties are discussed, followed by the results of the full background estimation in
section~\ref{sec:boost_results}. This chapter concludes, in section~\ref{sec:boost_interpretation},
with the interpretation of the results in terms of several simplified model spectra.

\section{Results \label{sec:boost_results}}

We present the results of the background prediction for each bin in the $(\mr,\rsq)$ plane in
Fig.~\ref{fig:results_prediction} and Table~\ref{tab:results_prediction}. The results are presented
as the mean and standard deviation as determined from the sampled prior $\pi(\theta)$
described in Section~\ref{sec:boost_systematics}.  
The observations are found to be in good agreement with the standard model prediction. Consequently,
no evidence of a signal is observed.

\section{Interpretation in terms of simplified model spectra \label{sec:boost_interpretation}}

% ref{sec:sms}


We interpret our results in terms of the SMS processes {\it T1ttcc} and {\it T1t1t} shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:T1ttcc_T1t1t_diagrams}. These models have three free mass parameters: the gluino, 
top squark and LSP mass. We will vary the gluino mass between 600 and 1300\GeV, and the LSP 
mass between 1 and 700\GeV. The mass difference between top squark and LSP, $\Delta m$, is kept
fixed at 10, 25 or 80\GeV for the T1ttcc model, and at 175\GeV for the T1t1t model. 

To get a sense of the expected signal sensitivity, we show the signal efficiencies for the T1ttcc
and T1t1t simplified models in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_T1ttcc_T1t1t}. 
Efficiencies of up to 6\% in the most highly boosted regimes  are reached. 
For the T1ttcc model a drop in efficiency is observed for the strip with lowest neutralino
mass ($m_{\chi_1^0} = 1\GeV$), which can be explained by Lorentz boosts. For LSP masses higher than
the mass of the charm quark, the LSP will assume most of the momentum.  For the strip with the
lowest LSP mass, however, the LSP and the charm quark have about equal mass, so that after the boost
they will share the momentum about equally.  This results in a softer \ETm spectrum and therefore a
lower $\rsq$ value, which reduces the efficiency substantially.

Figure~\ref{fig:boost_limits} shows the observed and expected limit using the CLs method for the
T1ttcc model with $\Delta m=10,25,80$\GeV and for the T1t1t model. This analysis has
made significant inroads into the parameter space of the T1ttcc model. 
Gluinos with mass up to about 1\TeV have been excluded for neutralinos with mass less than about
500\GeV, when the top squark decays to a charm and a neutralino and $\Delta m < 80\GeV$. This also
means that top squarks with masses up to about 500\GeV have been excluded for small mass
differences with the LSP, given the existence of a gluino with mass less than about 1\TeV. 
Similarly, for the T1t1t model, top squarks with a mass up to about 450\GeV have been excluded
for the scenarios with $\Delta m = 175\GeV$ and gluino mass less than 900\GeV.
Coming back to our cartoon from the introduction in Section~\ref{sec:boost_motivation}, we have now
filled in several of the gaps. This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:boost_story_final}.
