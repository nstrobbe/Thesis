Brett, since I met you, my life has never been the same. We have seen and done so many fun things
over the past couple years. 
Thank you for being there through all the mad times, rushing to meet one or the other deadline. 
The last couple months were not easy, with us living 800km apart. The evenings spent talking
until past midnight about all our future plans really kept me going. 
Now, we are embarking on a brand new and very exciting adventure in Chicago. 
We cannot know what the future will hold, but I know that we can conquer anything together!
